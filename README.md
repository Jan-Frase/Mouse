Chess move generator built by Jan Frase in Rust :)

# Development Dependencies

For benchmarking:

- [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs): which uses 'gnuplot' or, if not available, 'plotters' for
  plotting.
- [iai](https://github.com/bheisler/iai): which uses 'Cachegrind' from 'Valgrind' as a VM.
